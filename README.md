# Pyxis_Version_1.1

PURPOSE OF PYXIS: -> Pyxis means "Compass" in Latin. In early days, the compass combined with the positions of the stars helped sailmen 
and merchants find way to their destinations as well as information about their positions on the so believed "Flat Earth". My goal is 
to build "the compass" of the 21st Century, not a device made out of wood and a metal needle :-) but a phone app that help users know
not just about their location in the map, but also their current address, weather, events, places of interests, local news, etc.

Ultimate goal: --> Implmenet the following APIs:
   
         -Google Reverse GeoLocation to get coordinates (done)
         -Google Places to obtain the address (done)
         -Google Map to obtain and move the camera toward the current location (done)
         -OpenWeatherApi to obtain current weather and Icon of current weather (done)
         -Google Places filtered by: 
               
                 - Restaurants
                 - Entertainment: Museums, Acuariums, Game Arcades, etc 
                 - Places of Interests including Historical places --> Maybe expand Wikipedia API to read more about the places you visit
                 - Bars / night Life - Religious Life - Etc Notes: --> Implement Wikipedia API to find out more about the places you visit --> Implement Yelp to obtain reviews or more details about the places

-->Implement Local News APIs: 
         - Refer to USA today API 
         - New York Times API 
         - LA Times API

-->Implement EventBrite and other eventType/sites such as Meetups around you
This is an onGoing project. Making steady progress. I'm mainly focusing on the functionaly right now, rather than having a smooth UI.

Top priority: Functionality
      Medium: Efficiency and Optimizations
         Low: Building a great UI
NOTE: Let me know if you would like to contribute to this project. Thanks for reading, Tuan
